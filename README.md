# Forecasting-Project
For the above forecasting project i have used different approaches for the EDA and data visualization
initially we cleaned the data and then applied transformations for the accurate data structure for stationarity improvement for training the model 
then i have used equation based models and Neural Network models which are 
  1. ARIMA Model
  2. NN models such as CNN, LSTM, GRU
  3. Simple Exponential Smoothing
  4. Holt's Exponential Smoothing
  5. Holt-Winters' Exponential Smoothing
  6. the models are trained, validated and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squareed Error(MSE),         Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE)
After building the models comparing the values i have choose the ARIMA Model for the better predicting model
then the deployment is done on streamlit
